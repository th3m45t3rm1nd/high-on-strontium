This is the obligatory About page where I have to tell you who I am. Well, that question is what I am figuring out myself, but anyways, I will tell you what I know about myself already.

- I have been arbitrarily told that I am a Homo sapiens (commonly known as a Human Being). Should I believe it? I don’t know.
- I am a person with high attention deficit, that I know for sure.
- I sure do love Animes, Movies, and Music. If you want, we can talk about them.
- Some even say I am an [INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality).

Well, that’s all I know. If you learn something about me, contact me.
